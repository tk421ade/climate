At this time, it was still largely covered by dense broadleaf forests and a cool-temperate climate that prevented ice from forming in West Antarctica.\nEast and West Antarctica react very different to external conditions\nIn order to better understand where the first permanent ice formed in Antarctica, the AWI paleoclimate modelers combined the newly available data together with existing data on air and water temperatures and the occurrence of ice. \"The simulation has supported the results of the geologists' unique core,\" says Prof Dr Gerrit Lohmann, paleoclimate modeler at the AWI. \"This completely changes what we know about the first Antarctic glaciation.\" According to the study, the basic climatic conditions for the formation of permanent ice only prevailed in the coastal regions of the East Antarctic Northern Victoria Land. Here, moist air masses reached the strongly rising Transantarctic Mountains -- ideal conditions for permanent snow and subsequent formation of ice caps. From there, the ice sheet spread rapidly into the East Antarctic hinterland. However, it took some time before it reached West Antarctica: \"It wasn't until about seven million years later that conditions allowed for advance of an ice sheet to the West Antarctic coast,\" explains Hanna Knahl, a paleoclimate modeler at the AWI. \"Our results clearly show how cold it had to get before the ice could advance to cover West Antarctica that, at that time, was already below sea level in many parts.\" What the investigations also impressively show is how different the two regions of the Antarctic ice sheet react to external influences and fundamental climatic changes. \"Even a slight warming is enough to cause the ice in West Antarctica to melt again -- and that's exactly where we are right now,\" adds Johann Klages.\nThe findings of the international research team are critical for understanding the extreme climate transition from the greenhouse climate to our current icehouse climate. Importantly, the study also provides new insight that allows climate models to simulate more accurately how permanently glaciated areas affect global climate dynamics, that is the interactions between ice, ocean and atmosphere.

However, it took some time before it reached West Antarctica: \"It wasn't until about seven million years later that conditions allowed for advance of an ice sheet to the West Antarctic coast,\" explains Hanna Knahl, a paleoclimate modeler at the AWI. \"Our results clearly show how cold it had to get before the ice could advance to cover West Antarctica that, at that time, was already below sea level in many parts.\" What the investigations also impressively show is how different the two regions of the Antarctic ice sheet react to external influences and fundamental climatic changes. \"Even a slight warming is enough to cause the ice in West Antarctica to melt again -- and that's exactly where we are right now,\" adds Johann Klages.\nThe findings of the international research team are critical for understanding the extreme climate transition from the greenhouse climate to our current icehouse climate. Importantly, the study also provides new insight that allows climate models to simulate more accurately how permanently glaciated areas affect global climate dynamics, that is the interactions between ice, ocean and atmosphere. This is of crucial importance, as Johann Klages says: \"Especially in light of the fact that we could be facing such a fundamental climate change again in the near future.\"\nUsing new technology to gain unique insights\nThe researchers were able to close this knowledge gap with the help of a unique drill core that they retrieved during the expedition PS104 on the research vessel Polarstern in West Antarctica in 2017. The MARUM-MeBo70 drill rig developed at MARUM in Bremen was used for the first time in Antarctica. The seabed off the West Antarctic Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers is so hard that it was previously impossible to reach deep sediments using conventional drilling methods. The MARUM-MeBo70 has a rotating cutterhead, which made it possible to drill about 10 meters into the seabed and retrieve the samples.\nThe research project, and the Polarstern expedition PS104 in particular, was funded by the AWI, MARUM, the British Antarctic Survey, and the NERC UK-IODP Programme.\n\n\nEnd of article.\n\nAnswer the following questions.\n\nParagraph two: Is this article related with climate change?
